With more body than a traditional Belgian pils, Blue Paddle is reflective of Europe's finest pilseners.","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"German-Style Pilsener","cat_name":"German Lager"},{"id":"432","brewery_id":"367","name":"Lager","abv":"4","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Lager","cat_name":"North American Lager"},{"id":"437","brewery_id":"1264","name":"Imperial Porter","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"Porter","cat_name":"Irish Ale"},{"id":"438","brewery_id":"1264","name":"Amber Ale","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Amber/Red Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"440","brewery_id":"296","name":"Abt 12","abv":"10","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"The absolute top quality in the hierarchy of the St. Bernardus beers.

It is a medium-bodied, malt-accented dark brew, very opaque and deep-sepia in color, with a chewy texture and a firm, creamy, long-lasting head. In spite of its dark color, it comes across as a soft and elegant brew that is rich, mild, and surprisingly balanced. It never tastes harsh, toasty or acrid. The beer is often referred to as a Schwarzpils, a \"black Pils,\" but, unlike a blond Pils, which can be assertively bitter, the hop bitterness in Schwarzbier is always gentle and subdued.\n\nIn a glass, Schwarzbier looks much like a British dark ale, but looks can be deceiving. Schwarzbier, unlike a British ale, has a clean lager taste that leaves next to no perception of fruitiness on the palate. Instead, Schwarzbier produces very mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Like most traditional German lagers, Schwarzbier has a malty middle, but the sweetness is never cloying or overpowering. The beer is moderately to well attenuated and the finish tends to be dry. Its alcohol level by volume is in the range of 4.5 to 5%, rarely higher. To accentuate the Schwarzbier's dark elegance and appealing head, always serve it in a tall, fluted or tulip-shaped glass.","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","cat_name":"German Lager"},{"id":"481","brewery_id":"296","name":"St. Bernardus Tripel","abv":"8","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"This beer, with high fermentation, has a pale amber colour and a flowery, fruity taste with a harmonious balance between sweet and sour (8% alcohol content). \nThis beer has a thick and vivid froth and strikes by its balanced taste with a delicate bitterness.","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","cat_name":"Belgian and French Ale"},{"id":"484","brewery_id":"1204","name":"Double Bastard Ale","abv":"10","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Pale Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"485","brewery_id":"7","name":"Rochefort 6","abv":"7.5","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"eddish colour, almost like autumn leaves, very consistent texture with a slightly spicy aroma and an intense taste of caramel, fruit, and hints of raisins.

In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer

period of the British Empire. It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India.\n\nBritish troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century.\n\nAmerican home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors.\n\nBig Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter, flavor, finish, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","cat_name":"North

elements, this ale is made with three malts and one hop. Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesn't end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk, clean bitterness.","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2532","brewery_id":"146","name":"Altbier","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Brown Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2533","brewery_id":"1204","name":"4th Anniversary IPA","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2534","brewery_id":"1207","name":"Sunday River Alt","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Brown Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2535","brewery_id":"891","name":"Altmans Alt","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Brown Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2536","brewery_id":"1097","name":"Black Forest Schwarzbier","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","cat_name":"German Lager"},{"id":"2537","brewery_id":"1127","name":"Altbier","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Brown Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2538","brewery_id":"1310","name":"Old 8444 Alt","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Brown Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2539","brewery_id":"1371","name":"Lone Mountain Altbier","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Brown Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2540","brewery_id":"1057","name":"Thunderhead Schwarz Bier","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"German-Style Schwarzbier","cat_name":"German Lager"},{"id":"2541","brewery_id":"556","name":"Ad Astra Ale","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style Brown Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2542","brewery_id":"1104","name":"Oktoberfest","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"German-Style Oktoberfest","cat_name":"German Lager"},{"id":"2544","brewery_id":"1230","name":"Oktoberfest","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"German-Style Oktoberfest","cat_name":"German Lager"},{"id":"2545","brewery_id":"1372","name":"Mister Hoppy IPA","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2546","brewery_id":"1070","name":"Hopyard IPA","abv":"5.300000190734863","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"2548","brewery_id":"244","name":"Gueuze","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","cat_name":"Belgian and French Ale"},{"id":"2549","brewery_id":"580","name":"Brain Damage","abv":"0","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"Old Ale","cat_name":"British Ale"},{"id":"2560","brewery_id":"563","name":"London Porter","abv":"5.400000095367432","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"Porter","cat_name":"Irish Ale"},{"id":"2561","brewery_id":"953","name":"Dark Island","abv":"4.599999904632568","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"Dark Island is an iconic beer: a standard-bearer for traditional Scottish ales.

This type of ale is brewed with malt, wheat and oats. It is unfiltered, which allows protein and yeast to remain suspended in the beer and creates the cloudy appearance.

This style was created by Trappist Monks in Belgium over 500 years ago. To be true to the style, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer, a creamier carbonation, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light.\n\nWhen you try this beer you're in for a unique treat.

Staying true to the experimental nature of the series and the â€œnever settleâ€ philosophy of Deschutes, our brewers went back to the drawing board to create an amplified version of last yearâ€TMs monument to hops.\n\nHead Brewer Brett Porter says, â€œThis is a truly exciting and groundbreaking beer. We reformulated everything about the hop recipe to give Hop Henge an extraordinary aroma and flavor similar to a fresh hop beer.â€ In addition to the Cascade and Centennial hops, Deschutes Brewery is experimenting with a hop variety so new that it has yet to be named.\n\nThe team here at Bend Public House recommends Hop Henge as the perfect accompaniment for a variety of spicy foods, so be sure to have a bottle handy next time you make a batch of hot wings and go for the five alarm award. The high-octane hoppiness is a wildly refreshing antidote to a wide array of hot foods.\n\nLimited Availability April through June.\n\nDon't miss this amazing hop experiment that is sure to leave your taste buds begging for more.\n\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/Brews/Bond+Street+Series/default.aspx\n\nAvailable April through June.\n\nHop Henge I.P.A. was first brewed in 2006 as an agressive West Coast style I.P.A. In 2007, Hop Henge is going Imperial!  Several pounds of  Centennial, Cascade and Northern Brewer hops are in each barrel with a heavy dry-hop presence to top it off.  A blend of crystal, pale and caraston malts creates an overall biscuity characteristic that is dense and muscular, building the alcohol base to support the monstrous hop profile.\n\nLike the rest of the Bond Street Series, Hop Henge highlights the creativity and curiosity of our brewers.  Bolder than its English ancestors, with huge hops and a bitter finish, this IPA is no wallflower.\n\nAlcohol By Volume: 8.1%\n\t\n\nIBU 95\n\nWhen one of our brewers suggested we name our new IPA Hop Henge, he also came up with the idea of actually recreating Stonehenge, only with hop bales.  We were up for the challenge and even though the weather did not want to cooperate, we pulled it off and threw a party afterwards.\n\t\n\n\nphoto: chris mather\nRatings, Awards & Notables\n\nWorld's Best Strong Pale Ale (Imperial IPA)\n2007 World Beer Awards\n\nWorld's 50 Best Beers\n2006 International Beer Challenge\n\nGold Medal, 92 Points\n2006 World Beer Championships\n\nSilver Medal, India Pale Ale Category\n2006 Australian International Beer Awards\n\nModern Brewery Age, February 12, 2007\n5 out 5 stars \nHop Henge started its life as an India Pale Ale, but this year it was bumped up to â€œImperial IPAâ€ status, with a hefty dose of additional hops.\nâ€œThis one is lovely,â€ said taster Tom Conti. â€œThey got it just right.â€\nIt pours out a deep amber, with an appealing rocky head, and rich hop aroma wafting from the glass. â€œThey sure dosed it with a lot of hops...[thereâ€TMs] a lot of hop bitterness in the taste,â€ one taster observed.\nIn addition to the Imperial-level hopping, Hop Henge also boasts Imperial-level alcohol content, with 8.1% a.b.v.\nThis was the top-rated beer during its tasting session, and tasters had to dig deep for new superlatives to describe it. â€œThis is a beautiful beer,â€ concluded taster Gregg Glaser. â€œFull of flavor and hops and malt and hops again.â€\nâ€œNot for the timid,â€ said taster Robert Lachman.\n\n-http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/BrewPub/OnTap/125352.aspx","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","cat_name":"North American Ale"},{"id":"4633","brewery_id":"538","name":"First Flight Amber Ale","abv":"4.5","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"Our first beer brewed right here at Flyers.

The Mad Brewer Maibock is medium amber in color.  Though similar in color to our Pipe Organ Pale Ale, it is very different in character.  Don't let it get you though, it's a very strong beer at about 7% alcohol. It has a very clean and malty nose.  The hop bitterness is evident, but not dominant.  The Mad Brewer Maibock will finish quite full and have a delicate sweetness.","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"German-Style Heller Bock/Maibock","cat_name":"German Lager"},{"id":"4677","brewery_id":"1248","name":"Heavenly Hefeweizen","abv":"4.5","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"I'm sure everyone here knows, Pittsburgh has some humid summers.

Allay your fears my friends because I'm going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor, adds B vitamins, and improves the beer as it ages.","add_user":"0","last_mod":"2010-07-22 20:00:20 UTC","style_name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen","cat_name":"German Ale"},{"id":"4678","brewery_id":"1286","name":"Scratch #12 2008","abv":"6.5","ibu":"0","srm":"0","upc":"0","filepath":"","descript":"In our never-ending pursuit of answering the burning question of what's new, we present Scratch #12-2008, an IPA.\n \nThe IPA is a fickle beast; too much malt and you veer into a high-octane hopbomb, while too little hops can question a beer's virility.

We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hops... Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront, but strides at a steady pace, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aroma... we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip.

Nine years ago, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale.

We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit, no matter what the time, expense, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale.\n\nOur efforts do not go unrewarded – Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness.

The lowest in alcohol (and usually flavor) is called \"bitter\" or \"ordinary bitter.\"  A step up in alcohol and hop character gives us \"best bitter\" or \"special bitter.\"  Finally a beer is made that is full of hop aroma and flavor, has a maltiness to match, and a generous amount of alcohol is called an \"extra special bitter\" or E.S.B.\n\nAlthough inspired by the British Ales  Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale uses distinctive American hops, which give not only the crisp bitterness to balance the malt, but also a hint of floral aroma.

They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.\n\nSome stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery.
