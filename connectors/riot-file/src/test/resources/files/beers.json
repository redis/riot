From Scotland, this malt is still produced in the tradition of turning over the barley by hand, resulting in a malt that is unsurpassed in its quality. Golden Promise is also used extensively by premium whisky distilleries such as The Macallan. This malt provides the backbone for the intense hop character. Four American hop varieties are used at a rate of over three pounds per barrel. The result is a rich malt sweetness infused with bright hop flavor and aroma from beginning to end.

The mills are  gone now, but the smokestacks still stand testament to Bend's humble beginnings. \n\nBuzzsaw Brown is an easy-drinking beer that is refreshing after a hard day's work. The timber mills in Bend may be closed, but whether your adventure includes a day of scaling rock faces, hitting 18 holes or skiing the slopes in spring, Buzzsaw Brown is the perfect end to a fun-filled day.\n\nâ€œBuzzsaw Brown is one of my favorite beers,â€ says Deschutes Brewery Brewmaster Larry Sidor. â€œThe unique combination of European and American malts makes it a very food friendly beer that pairs well with a wide variety of flavors.â€",
