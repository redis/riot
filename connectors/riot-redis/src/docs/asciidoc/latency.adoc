= Measuring Latency

This recipe shows you how to measure client-side latency to a Redis database using {project-title}.

== Prerequisites

For this recipe you will require the following:
 
* Redis database
* {project-title} host machine

== Installing {project-title}

Let's install {project-title} on a host machine. This can be any machine with network access to the Redis databases.

== Calculating Latency

We are now all set to begin the latency calculation process.

[source,console]
----
riot-redis -h <host> -p <port> latency
----

When the latency tests are finished you will see statistics like these:

[source,console]
----
[min=0, max=19, percentiles={50.0=1, 90.0=3, 95.0=6, 99.0=10, 99.9=17}]
----
